Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Datasets (2:30)
  RStudio (5:55)
  datasets (5:43)
  
I use the spelling datasets instead of data sets, it is also the package name.]
RStudio is the name of the IDE (a product).

I have included URLs that do not exist yet, but will exist once the package is accepted.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
